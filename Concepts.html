  <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
  <p>Here are some important concepts that help explain how HTTP works and evolves:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Concept</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>HTTP</strong></td>
      <td>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the language used for communication between browsers and web servers. It defines how requests and responses are sent, allowing websites to function.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>HTTPS</strong></td>
      <td>HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP that encrypts communication using SSL/TLS. It protects sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers from being intercepted.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Persistent Connections</strong></td>
      <td>Allow multiple HTTP requests and responses to use the same network connection, improving speed and reducing delays. Introduced in HTTP/1.1.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Multiplexing</strong></td>
      <td>Multiplexing allows multiple requests to be sent at the same time over one connection. Used in HTTP/2 to make websites load faster, especially those with many images or videos.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>QUIC</strong></td>
      <td>A transport protocol used by HTTP/3 that runs on UDP instead of TCP. It increases speed, reduces latency, and helps prevent data loss on unstable networks.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Headers</strong></td>
      <td>Information sent along with HTTP requests and responses, such as browser type, content type, or caching rules. Headers help websites behave correctly and securely.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Error Codes</strong></td>
      <td>Messages that show when something goes wrong with a request. For example, “404 Not Found” means the page doesn’t exist, while “500 Internal Server Error” indicates a server issue.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
